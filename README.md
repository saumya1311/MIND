Idea: An intelligent system that auto-generates decision trees to aid strategic mission planning based on objectives, constraints, and real-time data.
Working: takes user inputs, dynamically builds and visualizes optimized decision paths to support faster and more accurate decisions.
Tech Stack: Python, Tkinter (GUI), scikit-learn (logic), JSON (data storage), Graphviz (visualization).
